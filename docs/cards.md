# In the Cards

No worries, ArenaGS is not a card game, but is using cards as a model for the character customization system described in [Progress to Progression](progression.md).

To summarize, each node in a skill tree and items from battles/shops all give you cards. These cards are slotted into slots to customize your skills/stats/passive abilities.

After about a half a month of work, I have some preliminary screens to share.

This is the skill tree (the nodes themselves are just dev test data).

The idea here is that you'll spend some currency, experience, fame, or influence in a set of nodes that unlock skills that you can depend on every single run. 

This helps reduce the "unlucky" factor of not seeing a "common" card over and over again.

The nodes will likely not be super flashy, even a tad boring, but that helps make drops and shot purchases the exciting steak to the skill tree's potatoes.

This is where you slot the equipment/items you unlocked to take effect. Right now there are four types:

- Weapon Parts (Red)
- Armor Mods (Blue)
- Accessory Items (Green)
- Masteries (Purple)

Total number of nodes is to be determined, but I expect more Red than others on average.

Now that we have a system for unlocking various basic abilities and slotting them into place, the next step is to rework the skill system to allow dynamically created skills (from those items).
