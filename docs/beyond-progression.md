# Beyond Progression

It's been a bit of a slog, but I'm finally feature complete on the progression features laid out in [Progress to Progression](progression.md).

Here's the [video showing it off](https://youtu.be/qXTDqI0st74).

Overall the work included:

- Removing all hard coded skills and creating a template and modifier system to build up skills based upon selected equipment.
- Teaching gunslinger to correctly handle having less than 3 ammo types
- Creating equipment items, of various rarities, with different effects, and a system to randomly generate sets of them.
- A reward screen to select one of three items (or some influence).
- A "skill tree" of equipment items for the profession tab.
- A draggable card based equipment screen with slots to equip items
- A merchant to spend cold hard influence on an extended range of cards, or equipment slot upgrades.
- A really cool "preview" tab, which dynamically creates ab info and skill bar based upon selections to preview before starting the next battle.
- Reworking help to somehow work with all of this

Really happy with all of that in about 1 1/3 months of evening work.

With that out of the way, the major gameplay systems I envision for now are all plumbed in. Next up would be gobs of content and hopefully "finding the fun" in builds and combat. 

For preview two I hope to have:
- All of the equipment items stubbed out implemented, and a bunch more. I'd like around 30 items, so the same item won't come up every run, but that might be too aggressive.
- More arenas, at least four, to add visual variety.
- More fights. Maybe one more boss (to end the run), and some popcorn enemies to throw at the player in large numbers.
- A title screen, conclusion after beating "the boss", and credits.
