# First Milestone

This weekend I reached the first major project milestone:

## Achievement Unlocked: Someone else actually played your game

After completing the last major rounds of bugfixing and polish, I kicked off a tiny "Friends and Family" preview of what I have so far. 

I plan on extending it to include a few folks from work who's expressed interest later this week. 

The plan is to get a small number of people (less than ten) to try out what I've made so far and provide frank and honest feedback.

Here's the video of current game play:

## What's next?

So far I've focused on only 2/3rds of the gameplay, the actual turn to turn combat. Getting this right is critical, since fighting in arena style combat is the the primary gameplay activity.

However, today the skills and abilities and completely fixed. You always have 13 total abilities, 3 ammo types, and 2 dodge. Your character never grows to this point or progresses further.

There needs to be an in-run progression system where you unlock abilities and improvements over many choices to customize your character to your preference and the run encounters.

I have a sketched out plan on how I expect this to work, which will have to wait for another future Devlog, hopefully up soon.
