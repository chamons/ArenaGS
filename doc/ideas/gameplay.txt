- Game starts off throwing you in a room to pick a weapon
- Increasing rounds of Arena "brawler" combat, seperated by rounds to purchase
- Long term, some form of faction / story / etc system where after while you get into empire intrigue and picks sides. But that can wait until we have a functional core.

No start screen / credits / etc. Try to do everything in game. Game loads you into save if exists, else start new game. Closing app saves.
