For lack of a better term right now, schools will determine the various ability flavors that color both weapon upgrades and other items. They will generally be divided into arcane and tech, but some "special" hybrid will exist that break the rules.

Arcane Schools - Divided into duality pairs of opposites. 

Pyro / Cyro - Fire and Ice, the elemental schools. Pyro sets burning and does raw damage. Cyro controls and setup frozen for additional damage
Warping / Temportal - Bending of space and time respectively. Warping slows physical movement (gravity), disables, and does damgage over time. Temporal bends time, speeds/slows, and the like.
Binding / Enchantment - Binding summons outside elemental spirits to the will of the caster. Enchantment turns magic inward to improve and transform the very body and essence of the mage.

Tech - Four schools of research working to bend the laws of physics to the service of mankind

Chemistry - Flametossers, tonics and potions, acid, and non-gunpower based explosives
Steam - Steam powered suit, gloves, etc. Maybe multiple forms of gas?
Clockwork - Golems, turrets, and other forms of "artificial" life. Complexity and limited intelligence.
Gunpower - Guns. Lots of guns. Grenades, flashpowder. 

Is there a generic "arcane/tech catagory"? What about hybrid / artifact / one of a kind?
