At beginning of game, select one of six weapons. Each weapon is associated with a range and an arcane/tech faction:

- Long Range (Staff / Rifle)
- Medium Range (Wand / Pistol)
- Short Range (Rapier / Gauntlet - think Steampunk)

Each weapon has a number of "slots" for upgrades, which improve and transform the associated abilities granted. 

For example, the Staff might provide the following abilities by default (no upgrades):

- AoE: Wall of Force
- Single Target: Piecing Blast
- Movement: Teleport
- Reaction: Block

And gems might change them to something like

- AoE (with Pyro gem) - Firestorm (AoE field damage with knockback)
- Single Target (with Cyro gem) - Icicle
- Movement (with Temporal gem) - Time Stop
- Reaction (with Arcane) - Arcane Armour

Similar idea with tech. Each weapon will have a number of typed slots, and each element will transform it somehow.

In addition, a number of slots will be available for "other" gear. Things like grenades, potions, scrolls, summons, turrets/summones, etc. Each will be a limited use charge system.

As the rounds progress, both the primary weapon skills and additional powers will increase in complexity but likely not power. We don't want a level 10 fireball vs level 1 fireball damage difference. But maybe your more advanced abilities will inflict status elements that you can combo for additional effects. 

Increase complexity, not bigger stick to hit people with.
