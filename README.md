# ArenaGS
## Arena: Gunpowder and Sorcery

ArenaGS is a roguelike arena battler with 16-bit aesthetics and hopefully a modern design.

Here's what it looks like today:

A public preview is months away at this point.

# Building
ArenaGS uses paid art from a number of sources, which can't obviously be places in this repo without hurting the artists in question.

In the future you'll be able to use a released version of ArenaGS to 'bootstrap' a build using the released art.

You can run the large test suite locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/chamons/ArenaGS.git
cargo build
cargo test
```
