- We mostly want all of ArenaGS's combat with none of the SDL
- Except, we don't want any of the progression, or help
- Do we want the raise event thing that exists, or should we do tagged systems like other systems
- How do we do multi-step - "cast animation", then projectile flies, then explode?
   - The multipart system is ugly but works
- There are orbs, and damage fields, and many other options, do we want to port them all at once?

- How do we move the world, while rewriting some of it
