- Initial orb has "don't stand there" for next SPEED points somehow linked to it (?)
- Initial orb has a timer and ai that moves
- Need some sort of "OrbComponent" to store remaining range and full path (so we don't recal in flight and get diff answer)
- On turn move forward that many squares, if we run into a character boom
- Write tests:
   - Impact nothing
   - Impact something
   - Cast on something at ground zero
   - Bolt flies off screen
